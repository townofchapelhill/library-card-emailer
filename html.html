<p>Your library card is up for renewal! We renew cards every three years (annually for out of county patrons) to ensure we have updated contact information for our patrons.</p>
<p>To renew your card, please stop at a desk next time you&rsquo;re in the library with some ID showing your name and address. That&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;ll be good to go for another three years (another year for out of county patrons). You can also give us a call at 919-968-2777 if you need immediate assistance. Please do NOT reply to this email.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping us keep our records current.</p>
