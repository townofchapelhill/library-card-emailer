<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s about time to renew your library card!&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County residents, we renew cards every three years to ensure we have updated contact information for our patrons.&nbsp; For our Out-of-County users, Chapel Hill-Carborro City School teachers, and UNC students, we renew annually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To renew your card, please see a staff member next time you&rsquo;re in the Library with some ID showing your name and current address. That&rsquo;s it! Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County residents will be good to go for another three years; another year for all our other patrons. Please note, Out-of-County renewals are subject to the $65 annual fee. Should you need immediate assistance, you can give us a call at&nbsp;919-968-2777. Please do NOT reply to this email.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping us keep our records current and we look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
